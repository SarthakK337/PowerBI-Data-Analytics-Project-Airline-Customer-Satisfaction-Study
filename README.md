## Description of the Dashboard
* The dashboard has a user-friendly interface with buttons for navigation and an appropriate theme color. 
* The dashboard features various visualizations such as metrics and bar charts, line charts, maps, and filters. 
* One of the essential metrics used in the dashboard is the Top 2 Box Percentage (T2B%). 
* It is calculated by considering weights and the rating scale as factors for calculating means. 
* The T2B% metric is a percentage of people who rated 4 or 5 out of people who rated 1 to 5.

* These pages include Scorecard, Trends, Summary, Regional Analysis, and Compare. 
* The Scorecard page features a bar chart to show T2B% for the top five brands. 
* The header name changes dynamically as the Attribute Title slicer changes. 
* A button is provided to clear all filters, and all slicers are synchronized on all the pages.
* The Summary page features the same visualizations as the Scorecard page, but with all brands. 
* The Trends page showcases a line chart that shows trends for brand rating versus time for different attributes. 
* The Regional Analysis page shows region-wise brand perspective for a particular attribute. Finally, the Compare page features year-wise comparison and changes in the brand image, with conditional formatting. 
* Green color implies positive brand image, while red color implies negative brand image.
